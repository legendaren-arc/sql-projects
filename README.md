# SQL Projects Repository

Welcome to my **SQL Projects Repository** — a curated collection of data analysis projects built using **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.  
These projects highlight my ability to transform, clean, and analyze data through complex and efficient SQL queries.

Each project demonstrates real-world data applications — from managing and cleaning datasets to generating insights that support data-driven decisions.


## 🚀 Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
  Handling missing, inconsistent, and unstructured data to prepare datasets for analysis.

- **Complex Query Building**  
  Advanced use of **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**, **Window Functions**, **Joins**, and **Aggregate Functions** to solve practical data challenges.

- **Data Management & Transformation**  
  Implementation of normalization principles, and query optimization .

- **Insight Generation**  
  Converting raw data into meaningful insights that reflect trends, performance metrics, and behavioral patterns.


## 🧠 Tools & Technologies

- **Databases:** MySQL · PostgreSQL  
- **Techniques:** Data Cleaning · Data Transformation · Query Optimization · Window Functions · CTEs  
- **Focus Areas:** Data Analytics · Reporting · ETL Logic ·  Insights


## 💡 What You’ll Learn

Through these projects, I showcase how SQL can be used not just for data retrieval but as a **powerful analytical tool** for:  
- Deriving insights from structured datasets  
- Supporting evidence-based decision-making
