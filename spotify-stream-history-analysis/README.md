#  Spotify Streaming Data Analysis

*Data Cleaning & Analysis Project using MySQL* 

## Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes my personal Spotify streaming history using SQL. The goal is to clean, transform, and extract meaningful insights from my listening habits, including total streaming time, favorite artists, and trends over time. The dataset contains nearly 16,000 entries, requiring efficient handling of missing data, normalization, and transformation for further visualization.  

## Dataset Overview  
The dataset was obtained through Spotify's official data request and provided in JSON format. It was then extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) into MySQL for structured querying and analysis. The dataset consists of ~16,000 rows, capturing my Spotify listening history over time.
